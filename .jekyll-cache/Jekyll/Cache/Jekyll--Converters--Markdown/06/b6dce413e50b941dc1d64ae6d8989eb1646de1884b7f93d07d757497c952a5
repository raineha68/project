I"é<p>An American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctorâ€™s orders. Unable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to clear his head. A small boat with just one fisherman had docked, and inside the boat were several large yellow-fin tuna. The American complimented the Mexican on the quality of his fish.
â€œHow long did it take you to catch them?â€ the American asked.
â€œOnly a little while,â€ the Mexican replied in surprisingly good English.
â€œWhy donâ€™t you stay out longer and catch more fish?â€ the American then asked.
â€œI have enough to support my family and give a few to friends,â€ the Mexican said as he unloaded them into a basket.</p>
