Running has always enchanted me. Starting from my first 5 km run to half marathons, I have participated in many running events. When I turn back, I understand, marathon is not about running itself. It taught me the right attitude towards success. Running marathons actually equips you with five key ingredients of success:

<p style="margin:0"><h5 class="section-heading">Vision- The Entry Pass to Success:</h5></p>

<p style="margin:0">Every marathon starts with a dream. You seed the thought in your brain. Then you plan to finish it with flying colors. You decide on a lot of factors like fitness, practice, running path and other miscellaneous things. In every endeavor you should be able to envision steps to emerge victorious.</p>


<p style="margin:0"><h5 class="section-heading">Practice:</h5></p>

<p style="margin:0">Without practice, you will fail. Running marathon without proper training to your muscles teaches you, how important it is to prepare. It’s nearly impossible to run 42 or 21 kilometers without continuous effort. You have to run everyday to the maximum possibility and then increase your distance and pace on an incremental basis. This applies to almost every field. Famous martial artist Bruce Lee says:
“I fear not the man who has practiced 10,000 kicks once, but I fear the man who has practiced one kick 10,000 times.” — Bruce Lee</p>


<h5 class="section-heading">Determination- The Winning Mindset:</h5>

It’s not the iron legs but the mind of titanium, that wins you marathons. Strong will power gives you indomitable strength and paves your way to success and happiness. Marathon cultivates the determination, which makes you run hard even when you are tired, even when all juice is dried, and even when you think about giving up.


<h5 class="section-heading">The Art of Perseverance:</h5>

Perseverance may thought to be linked with determination. But there are subtle differences. You have to bear the searing heat of the sun or coldness of snow, elevation of the paths, pain in your muscles and thoughts in your mind. Like the test of fire shapes iron or gold to be more useful, perseverance makes you shine brighter.


<h5 class="section-heading">Inspiration- The Winning Moment:</h5>

Your motivations to do anything is controlled by dopamine releases in brain. Winning or achieving something gives you happiness and our brain will crave for more. You may fail too. You may not meet your envisaged time, speed position etc. The point is that we should learn from failures. From marathons you learn to take triumphs and setbacks with maturity. And you know that it doesn’t end here. Its a continuous journey of embarking on victories (and defeats).


“I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life and that is why I succeed.” — Michael Jordan
